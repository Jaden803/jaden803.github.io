      <h3>What inspired us</h3>
      <p>Being born and raised in Southern California, we grew up surrounded by all kinds of cultures with fantastic foods. As time went by, a lot of the goto burger joints were blending into each other and became saturated. So, we wanted to stand out. We decided to take SoCal's most popular foods to the next level by thinking outside the box. We decided to use fresh ingredients and herbs to create an everlasting taste and combine them with already amazing-tasting food to create an even better experience.</p>

        <h2>The Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog $6.29</h2>
        <p>One of our classics, It's not just any ordinary bacon-wrapped dog, it's a monster. It's stuffed and loaded with amazing and delicious toppings like bell peppers, jalapenos, pickles, onions, and tomatoes!</p>

        <h2>The Asian Chicken Salad $9.99</h2>
        <p>The sweet and savory favorite. Another popular choice for those who aren't craving insanely high-calorie foods with great flavor ðŸ˜Ž. The savory flavor of the sauce and the healthiness of the salad combined with the great source of protein from chicken make this a great pick for those looking to try something else.</p>
